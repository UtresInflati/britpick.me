Quick, easy, and customizable Britpicking for American (and other non-Brit) fic authors.

## The Story

I got tired of doing endless âŒ˜-F searches for various Americanisms in my fic, so I threw this little miniature webapp together to automate the process.

## The App

Right now, the app is running *entirely* on HTML (with [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for style) and JavaScript. Restricting the app to front-end technologies alone means I can host it for free here on GitHub, using the [GitHub Project Pages](http://pages.github.com/) feature, but it also limits the features I'm able to add. If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to contribute code, you can [contact me](mailto:utres.inflati.ambulamus@gmail.com).
